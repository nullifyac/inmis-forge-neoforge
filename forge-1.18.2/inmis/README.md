Inmis is a Backpack mod built for [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/).
By default, you can right-click a Backpack to open it, or press `B` to open the first Backpack available in your inventory.
Backpacks can be equipped in the Chestplate armor slot and opened through the same keybind.

### Compatibility

If you install [Curios API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios) alongside Inmis, you will be able to equip Inmis Backpacks in the back Curios slot.

For previewing Backpacks, try out [ShulkerBoxTooltip](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shulkerboxtooltip)!

### Configuration ƒsT

Inmis is fully configurable through the `config/inmis.json` file found in your game directory. 
This will allow to you disable main-inventory backpacks, require players to wear Backpacks in armor slots, and even allows you to add your own custom backpacks!
